		<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of effective writing. Each paragraph presents one main idea. One important piece of an excellent paragraph is coherence. Your sentences should flow from one to the next in a logical manner. There are several techniques that can help you achieve this flow. Make sure to carry over a topic from sentence to sentence. Use pronouns to carry over thoughts throughout the paragraph. Finally, make use of transitional words and phrases to segue between sentences. This activity will help you practice these techniques to create the perfect, coherent paragraph. You can review your text before or after to get more information on the three techniques.</p>
		<p>In this activity, you will be given scrambled paragraphs. Try to unscramble them into the correct order to create logical and coherent paragraphs! (<span class="bold"> Hint:</span> Try picking out the topic sentence first.)</p>

				<li data-position="0"><span>In 2011, we began clinical trials of the new drug, Paropraxolin with patients from St. Mary’s hospital.</span></li>
				<li data-position="1"><span>The results of the clinical trials have been positive, so the company decided last year to expand the trials to hospitals across the country.</span></li>
				<li data-position="4"><span>Working with me on this project are Raj Patel and Dina Laskey, students from Dalston University on a work term funded by a grant from the Anxiety Disorder Association of Canada.</span></li>

  		<ul>
  			<li data-position="3"><span>Our goal is to help your students develop essential mathematical skills using the learning methods that suit them best – through supportive individualized workshops, consultations, and hands-on experience.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="0"><span>We understand that the self-learning program and personalized training units currently used by your students to address weaknesses in their math skills do not provide them with the level of continuing support and suggestions for improvement both teachers and students are hoping to see.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="4"><span>Our proposed training program is designed to ensure your students become more confident and capable in their mathematical skills.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="2"><span>These new methods will allow students to build on the strong basic mathematical skills they may already have and to polish, master, and apply those skills to real-life situations they will encounter in their future careers.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="1"><span>A more successful program that meets those expectations and delivers the desired learning outcomes involves a combination of several different learning methods, including classroom instruction, regular individual practice, and immediate constructive feedback.</span></li>

  			<li data-position="1"><span>In a large industrial nation such as Canada, the media are woven into the complex social and cultural fabric.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="5"><span>And the humour is created by playing off our knowledge of these ideas.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="2"><span>For instance sitcoms, like The Simpsons, are written to play off our knowledge of and understanding of the world.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="6"><span>Similarly, sports, and hockey in particular, are a key element in our culture, and much media content is devoted to them, promoting values familiar to Canadians.</span></li>

  			<li data-position="5"><span>Other print shops have the capability of updating large print runs on demand without having to commit to one version for the entire run.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="2"><span>Due to slow turnarounds on short-run rush jobs, many of our long-time customers are reluctantly turning to our competitors for quicker delivery and overnight service.</span></li>

      <ul>
  			<li data-position="7"><span>Below are two solutions other print shops have implemented to reduce turnaround times and eliminate waste.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="3"><span>Revenues for the first and second quarters of 2013 were down by 15 per cent from the same period in 2012, in part due to the loss of accounts for short-run business.</span></li>
  			<li data-position="0"><span>Until recently, our offset lithographic environment has been effective in driving volume.</span></li>
